# Linux docs

Linux distributions comes with a vast set of command-line tools and it can be
difficult to keep track on what each does and when to use them. These documents
is written for having a common source of references about the command-line tools
i normally need to use. It is mainly written for Ubuntu systems which is the
distribution I normally use. But most of the instructions is applicable for other
unix-based systems aswell.

The level of detail may vary since the instruction is based on my own level of
knowledge and what problems I needed to address. I hope these documents can
serve as help for others aswell!

Documents is available @ <https://1nfiniteloop.github.io/linux-docs> from source
