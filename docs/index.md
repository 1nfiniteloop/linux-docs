# Linux docs

Linux distributions comes with a large set of command-line tools and it can be
difficult to keep track on what each does and when to use them. I wrote these
documents with the intention to have a common source of reference, as an overview
about the most common tools and their usage. It is mainly written for Ubuntu
which is the distribution I normally work on. But most of the instructions is
applicable for other unix-based systems aswell.

The level of detail may vary since the instructions is based on my own level of
knowledge and what problems I had to address. But I hope you also can find these
documents helpful!
